Becuase we used a wikipedia entry for our text, it uses very passive formal language. "is considered", "is located",



1. This rule is based on Korean being an SOV language whereas we are translating to English which is an SVO language. So whenever we encounter POS object (noun) followed by a verb, we will reverse the order of the two words.

2. When you are reordering the verb, consider it's relative position to adverbs to make sure to place the verb right after the adverb.

3. When you are reordering the noun, consider it's relative position to adjectives to make sure to place the noun after the adjectives.

4. to check if any noun is really a noun functioning as a subject, we check that it doesn't have apostrophe s, which would make it a adjective modifier.

5. if the verb is followed by a preposition, move that with the verb too.

6. if it sees a year (recognize it by four numbers), it appends a 'in' word at the before it.

7. if a word is adjective and contains 'ed', then is probably a verb past participle, so we fix the pos tag to be VBN for better result.

8. if a noun is followed by verb and preposition, then reorder it so that it is verb + preposition + noun (object)

if there's an apostrophe or parentheses boundary, keep reordering within the boundaries. (PROBABLY NOT THE KIND OF RULE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR)


we use commas for boundaries for reordering, and also iteratively rearrange verb placement similar to a tree structure.

the last verb that occurs in the sentence will almost always apply to the beginning of the sentence, and thus we will reorder as such.
Take the sentence, splice out the last verb which will almost always apply to the beginning. Then we separate the sentence into the smallest sentence phrases and reorder within these phrases, and then join them back together.

if two verbs next to each other, treat them as one (this comes up for the phrase 'is considered')


6. Reorder location (state, country)
In Korean, location is written from largest body to smallest, rather than smallest to largest in English. Also in Korean, for state locations, the word state is always appended right after, as in California state. So when we encounter USA followed by state name followed by state, we reorder, and remove the word state for the English translation.

*Additional Notes
We considered that after applying each rule to a sentence, to retag the entire sentence. However this would quickly become really messy and time consuming because it would be unclear when to stop.

---- CHALLENGES -----
the words that come after a korean word can change the form of that korean word, making translating directly very difficult, because it's hard to have a word-to-word dictionary mapping.

Another problem we encountered is the sentence 23% is Asian, because a POS can't know to tag a number like 23% as functioning as a subject. The tag CD doesn't help us in reordering.


In Korean there's often no direct translation of a word, but we must first distill it to a simpler form that does have a translation.
